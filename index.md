## About me

I am Tzu-An Wang, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at New York University, with graduation set for May 2025. My studies focus on areas such as DevOps, Agile Methodologies, Operating Systems, and Realtime Big Data Analytics, equipping me with the technical depth to address complex software engineering challenges.

With a solid grasp of programming languages like Python, C, Java, and JavaScript, I specialize in developing scalable, high-performance solutions. My expertise spans data management (Snowflake, MySQL, DynamoDB), web development (React.js, Node.js, Express.js), and cloud technologies (AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes), allowing me to deliver full-stack applications and seamless cloud integrations.

Professionally, I have honed my skills through hands-on experience. As a Software Engineer Intern at New York University, I led the migration of ETL processes from Oracle to Snowflake and refactored code using Snowpark to achieve a 30% performance boost. Additionally, I deployed automated time-series forecasting models on AWS for scalable student enrollment predictions. At Shaku Technology, I built a microservices architecture with REST APIs and managed cloud infrastructure processing millions of real-time transactions. My role as a Data Engineer at Just Kitchen involved optimizing Snowflake performance and deploying predictive models, resulting in cost savings and improved business intelligence.

I’ve also led the development of robust, scalable applications like LiveChat Lounge and DreamCart, applying my skills in DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, and secure authentication.

Driven by curiosity and precision, I am eager to continue growing as a software engineer, collaborating with teams to deliver impactful solutions.
